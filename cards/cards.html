          <h3>Mountains</h3>
          <p>
            Mountain biomes are diverse, high-altitude environments defined by
            steep slopes, varying temperatures, high winds, and intense UV.

          <p>
            Deserts are extremely dry environments that are home to well-adapted
            plants and animals. The main types of deserts include hot and dry
            deserts, semi-arid deserts, coastal deserts, and cold deserts.

          <p>
            There are three general types of forest that exist: temperate,
            tropical, and boreal. Experts estimate that these forests cover
            approximately one-third of Earth's surface.

          <p>
            The savanna biome consists of areas of open grassland with very few
            trees. Biomes are defined by their unique vegetation and animal
            life, and the savanna is a type of grassland biome.

            The ocean is a vast and dynamic ecosystem that covers over 70% of
            the Earth's surface. It is home to a wide range of organisms, from
            tiny plankton to massive whales.

            A snowy mountains biome, prominent in games like Minecraft,

          <p>
            The taiga, or boreal forest, is the largest terrestrial biome,
            characterized by long, cold winters and short, mild summers. It is
            dominated by coniferous trees like pine, spruce, and fir, and
            features thin, acidic soil and wildlife such as moose, bears,
            wolves, and lynxes.

          <p>
            The tundra is Earth's coldest biome, defined by long, harsh winters,
            low precipitation (like a desert), and permafrost (frozen soil) that
            prevents deep root growth, creating treeless plains with low-growing
            plants, mosses, and lichens.
